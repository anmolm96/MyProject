  * Idea first, Startup later
  * Company should feel like a mission. A Startup could last 10 years.
  * Find a small market to get a niche, and then expand quickly.
  * i.e Facebook, Snapchat. Doesn't need to sound big. Unpopular but right.
  * People should think you're idea is bad. People won't want to steal it.
  * Think about the growth of the market. But you cannot create a market.
  * Needs to be easily understandable.
  * Think about market first.

  * Product: Build something users love. Talk to users, not investors.
  * Easier to expand- Build something few people love.
  * Build something simple. Make people love the product.
  * Early organic growth = Sign of a good startup.
  * Find users to test the early products, and give feedback on it.
