Lecture 1 (Why Start a Startup?):
* Idea Product Team and Execution
  * Idea: Pivots don't become big companies
  * Long-term planning.
  * Idea first, Startup later
  * Company should feel like a mission. A Startup could last 10 years.
  * Find a small market to get a niche, and then expand quickly.
  * i.e Facebook, Snapchat. Doesn't need to sound big. Unpopular but right.
  * People should think you're idea is bad. People won't want to steal it.
  * Think about the growth of the market. But you cannot create a market.
  * Needs to be easily understandable.
  * Think about market first.

  * Product: Build something users love. Talk to users, not investors.
  * Easier to expand- Build something few people love.
  * Build something simple. Make people love the product.
  * Early organic growth = Sign of a good startup.
  * Find users to test the early products, and give feedback on it.
  * [Read Paul Graham's essay on Scaling]
  * Focus on growth: Active Users, Active Levels, Revenue and Retention.
* Don't need experience.

Lecture 2:
* Team:
  * Better to have a co-founder
  * It's good to know your team beforehand.
  * Need a tough cofounder, if you're calm.
  * Need a technical cofounder if you aren't one
  * Try not to employ. Bad hires kill the company.
  * Mediocre engineers do not make great companies.
  * Hires need aptitude, not experience.
  * Would you want to work with them? Communication is key
  * 10% to first 10 employees. Which they get over 4 years.
* Execution:
  * Year long grind of pushing code
  * CEO: Set the vision, Raise money, Evangelize,
  *      Hire and manage, Make sure company executes.
  * Focus: Work on 2-3 things and get them done.
  * Say No a lot, have overachieving goals, repeat.
  * Weekly meetings on metrics. Focus on growing metrics.
  * Small amount of extra work helps. If each user brings
  * a tiny bit of new users, company booms.
  * Relentless operating motive: Move fast, break things
  * While maintaining quality. And always keep momentum.

Lecture 3 (Before the Startup):
* Don't start a startup in college You can only be in your early 20s once.
* Startups consume your life. Don't try to start a startup.
* Work on side projects (aka Hackathon projects).
* When these projects start to consume your time, you will realize that it is a
* good product. Just Learn.
